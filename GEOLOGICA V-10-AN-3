## Abstract: 
_This study focuses on gold and related mineral investigation, in the Western Chagai belt. Sixteen oxide coloration and hydrothermal alteration zones, including a large quartz vein, have been examined and geochemically sampled for gold and other associated metals. Geological and geochemical studies indicate that the Saindak and Sorzuk Kaur xenothermal alteration zones (Toposheet No. 30 G/11), Reku Diq (previously called Koh-e-Dalil) tourmaline-quartz breccia pipe (Toposheet No. 30 K/4), and Sorbarot Koh quartz vein (Toposheet No. 30 G/16) exhibit anomalies indicative of gold mineralization. The average gold concentrations in these zones are 0.14 ppm, 0.34 ppm, 0.35 ppm, and 0.57 ppm, respectively._
