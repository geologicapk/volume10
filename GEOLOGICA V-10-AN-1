## Abstract: 
_Makori Anticline is one of the most important structures of the northeastern Kohat Fold Thrust Belt (KFTB). The purpose of this research work is to understand the structural kinematics of Makori Anticline within the Kohat Fold and Thrust Belt integrating surface data and construction of balanced cross sections. Geological map and cross sections of the study area indicate that the area has been deformed in a thin-skinned manner. East-west trending anticlines, synclines and thrust faults defined the area. The core rocks within the prominent anticlines and hanging wall stratigraphy of Banda Daud Shah and Zanka Ghar Faults indicate a shallow level detachment probably at the base of Bahadur Khel Salt. The attitude data collected on the fold limbs suggest a dominant south facing that is coherent with facing of Banda Daud Shah and Zanka Ghar Faults, and is a consequence of the compressional. Based on the forelimb and back limb geometry of the anticlinal folds several low angle imbricate splays from this basal detachment are interpreted. The deformation event in the region postdates the deposition of late Miocene to Pleistocene Siwaliks indicating that the age of compressional deformation is post- Pleistocene._
